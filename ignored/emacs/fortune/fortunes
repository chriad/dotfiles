A citation from Rich Cook.

"Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning."

nontechnical workers are using a

day-to-day lives. This should
contribute greatly to computer
literacy [...]

Such a dot just separates the car of a cons from its cdr.  (What's
 a cons?  Just a car with a cdr!)
